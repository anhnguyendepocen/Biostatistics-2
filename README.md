# Biostatistics

## Setup

Start here and familiarize yourself with the tools we will be using:


Github: https://github.com/join

(Note: Github now has a dropbox style drag and drop upload feature. There is also an online editor for creating or changing text files. No software or terminal commands needed.)


Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb


Lab Report: https://www.overleaf.com/read/qpfrmtfdjvbp


Lab Presentation: https://www.overleaf.com/read/xhsvcwnrkzns


Rex's Guide to Preparing a Lab Report

## General Lab Format

For each Lab the following will be submitted the following week to your Github:

1) Commented and Documented Colab Notebook (Upload .ipynb)
2) Written Lab Report Typed in Latex
3) Report Reformatted into Presentation Slides

### Watch: Biostatistics History
From time 8:50-18:00

"In 'the old days' (before computers with almost unlimited computational power were available), the statistical analysis of data was typically restricted to hypothesis tests... The advent of powerful computers has changed the game. Nowadays, the analysis of statistical data is (or at least should be) a highly interactive process: you look at the data, and generate models which may explain your data. Then you determine the best fit parameters for these models, and check these models, typically by looking at the residuals. If you are not happy with the results, you modify the model to improve the correspondence between models and data." p.121 - An Introduction to Statistics with Python With Applications in the Life Sciences by Thomas Haslwanter



### Why Python?
From: https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/intro.html#why-python
* Get data (simulation, experiment control),
* Manipulate and process data,
* Visualize results, quickly to understand, but also with high quality figures, for reports or publications.

Python’s strengths
* Batteries included - Rich collection of already existing bricks of classic numerical methods, plotting or data processing tools. We don’t want to re-program the plotting of a curve, a Fourier transform or a fitting algorithm. Don’t reinvent the wheel!
* Easy to learn - Most scientists are not payed as programmers, neither have they been trained so. They need to be able to draw a curve, smooth a signal, do a Fourier transform in a few minutes.
* Easy communication - To keep code alive within a lab or a company it should be as readable as a book by collaborators, students, or maybe customers. Python syntax is simple, avoiding strange symbols or lengthy routine specifications that would divert the reader from mathematical or scientific understanding of the code.
* Efficient code - Python numerical modules are computationally efficient. But needless to say that a very fast code becomes useless if too much time is spent writing it. Python aims for quick development times and quick execution times.
* Universal - Python is a language used for many different problems. Learning Python avoids learning a new software for each new problem.

Please read Python Notes 1 and the first two pages of Python Notes 2.
Prepare a new Colab Notebook and copy all of the relevant material from the python notes files to your new Colab notebook.
Think of the notebook as a quick access cheat sheet / recipe guide.

## Lab 2

### Read
First two chapters of

Comment as much of the code as you can, it is ok if you don't understand all of the pieces. Use the overleaf templates to create a new lab report and a new beamer presentation. Add the output images, code, and commentary from the notebook to each overleaf document.
